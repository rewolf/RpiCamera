# Raspberry Pi Camera Server - Development Plan

## Current Implementation (simple)
The current implementation uses a basic approach:
- Static HTML pages served by a simple HTTP server
- Bash script continuously capturing images
- Images saved to disk and served as static files

## Future Enhancement: On-Demand Camera System

### Overview
The goal is to create a more efficient system that only activates the camera when users are viewing the webpage. This approach saves power, reduces wear on the camera, and provides a more interactive experience.

### Architecture

```
+----------------+        WebSocket        +----------------+
|                |<----------------------->|                |
|  Web Browser   |   "start", "capture",   |  Node.js or    |
|  (Client)      |     "stop" messages     |  Python Server |
|                |                         |                |
+----------------+                         +----------------+
                                                  |
                                                  | System calls
                                                  v
                                           +----------------+
                                           |                |
                                           | libcamera-still|
                                           |                |
                                           +----------------+
```

### Key Components

1. **Web Server with WebSockets**
   - Replace simple HTTP server with Node.js or Python (Flask/FastAPI)
   - Implement WebSocket connections for real-time communication
   - Handle client connection/disconnection events

2. **Client-Side Application**
   - Modern JavaScript application (possibly with a framework like React)
   - WebSocket connection management
   - User interface for camera controls
   - Automatic reconnection handling

3. **Camera Control Service**
   - Start camera only when clients are connected
   - Process capture requests from clients
   - Manage camera settings
   - Implement efficient image delivery

### Benefits

- **Resource Efficiency**: Camera only runs when needed
- **Power Savings**: Important for battery-powered setups
- **Responsive**: Users get fresh images when they want them
- **Scalable**: Can handle multiple viewers efficiently
- **Interactive**: Allows for user control of the camera

### Potential Additional Features

- User authentication
- Camera setting adjustments (brightness, contrast, etc.)
- Motion detection
- Scheduled captures
- Time-lapse creation
- Mobile-optimized interface
- Image archiving

## Implementation Phases

1. **Research & Setup**: Choose technologies, set up development environment
2. **Core Functionality**: Implement basic WebSocket communication and camera control
3. **User Interface**: Create responsive, user-friendly frontend
4. **Testing & Optimization**: Ensure reliability and performance
5. **Additional Features**: Add enhancements based on priorities
